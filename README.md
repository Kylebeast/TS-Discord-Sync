## Getting Started

To get your TeamSpeak-Discord Sync Bot up and running, follow these steps:

### 1. **Set Up Configuration**

Before starting the bot, you need to make sure your TeamSpeak and Discord configurations are correct:

1. **Open the `ts3_discord_sync.py` file** in a code editor.
2. **Set your TeamSpeak server information**:
   - `ts3_server_ip`: Replace this with the IP address of your TeamSpeak server.
   - `ts3_username` and `ts3_password`: Provide your TeamSpeak Query login credentials.
   - `ts3_virtual_server_id`: Ensure this is the correct virtual server ID in your TeamSpeak server.

3. **Set your Discord Bot information**:
   - Replace the placeholder for `discord_token` with your Discord bot's token.
   
4. **Set the admin role ID**:
   - Update `admin_role_id` with the correct Discord role ID that grants admin permissions to users for admin commands.

5. **Map your Discord roles to TeamSpeak groups**:
   - Update the `role_mapping` dictionary with the correct mapping of Discord role IDs to TeamSpeak server group IDs.

### 2. **Install Dependencies**

If you haven't done so already, install the required dependencies for the bot:

```bash
pip install discord.py
pip install ts3


### 3. **Run the Bot**

Once you've set up the configurations and installed the dependencies, you can run the bot using the following command:

```bash
python ts3_discord_sync.py
